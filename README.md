###Why do you need to use ReducedJSON?
The trigger behind the development of this library is, I have been unable to find any smart JavaScript framework or a library which can help me find my target information from JSON data structure without writing a single line of parsing code. Most of the JavaScript and jQuery developers go through the situation where they have to write thousands of lines of code to parse the JSON data in order to find the required information and this has caused over head of the efforts in terms of time and money which ends up failure of the projects mostly. This has caused a dire need to develop such a reusable, highly optimised, highly response, less resource hungry, efficient and effective JavaScript library which can work with any existing JavaScript solutions and frameworks with cross browser functionality.
